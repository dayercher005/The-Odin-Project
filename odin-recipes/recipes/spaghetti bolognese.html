        <h3> Description: </h3>
        Spaghetti bolognese, or spag bol, as it's affectionately known , is what most of us would consider to be the quintessential Italian meal. However, In Italy, the thick, slow-cooked Bolognese sauce is usually served with flat pasta or in a lasagne. Our version starts with a soffritto mix of onion, celery and carrot (plus garlic) and is flavoured further by tomatoes, oregano and nutmeg. This particular version of spaghetti bolognese is diabetes-friendly, making it suitable for everyone's dinner.
